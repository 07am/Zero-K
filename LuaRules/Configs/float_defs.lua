-- initialRiseSpeed:    Velocity which unit "pushes off" the bottom
-- riseAccel:           Acceleration while trying to surface
-- riseUpDrag:          Drag on negative velocity while trying to surface
-- riseDownDrag:        Drag on positive velocity while trying to surface
-- sinkAccel:           Acceleration while trying to sink

-- sinkDownDrag:        Drag on positive velocity while trying to sink
-- airAccel:            Acceleration while out of water. aka gravity qhich is only active out of water
-- airDrag:             Drag on speed while out of water
-- waterHitDrag:        Reduction in speed upon hitting the water
-- floatPoint:          Position of unit base that denotes the surface of the water
-- depthRequirement:    Max depth of sea floor that float can be enabled
-- sinkOnPara:          If true the unit will set to sink if paralysed. In either mode state cannot be changed while paraed
-- sinkTankRequirement: Frames of delay (that must be spent in water) before a unit can sink. False if no delay required.
-- stopSpeedLeeway:     Below this speed the unit can snap to surface
-- stopPositionLeeway:  Below this distance from the surface the unit can stnap to surface.

-- PHYSIC UPDATE (4 April 2013): 
-- as in ZK version >= r9871 (>1.1.3.6) all "Drag" related constant now mean "dragCoefficient" from Physic's drag equation ( this equation here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_equation ),
-- from this physic equation, the negative acceleration (the resistance) is defined by :  resistiveAccel = 0.5*(currentVelocity*currentVelocity*dragCoefficient)
-- this mean faster unit has more drag, and bigger "Drag" cause more drag, while smaller "Drag" lead to less drag, while 0 "Drag" lead to 0 drag (and 0 drag will lead to infinite speed).
